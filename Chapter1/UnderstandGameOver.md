# Understand Game Over
---

This program demonstrates the print method in Python and shows the user that we can print certain english into the console screen 
and IDLE GUI

We also learn that using a # means you are commenting something so you remember why there was that in the first place

Comments are completely for humans and the computer skips right over what you put here. So make sure you don't put any code within these comments

* Blank lines in a program are also skipped because the computer doesn't need to read them
