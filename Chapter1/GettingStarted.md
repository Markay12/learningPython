# Why use Python?

It is easy to use
- High Level languages are closer to the human English and allow the programmer to understand what they are doing better
- Python is even closer to English and allows the user to write basic and simple instructions
- Python programs are shorter and take less to write

Powerful
- Able to process files, create GUI's and use a variety of data structures


Object Oriented (OOP)
- modern approach to solving programs
- an intuitive method of representing information and actions

* Python is great with this because it allows the user to choose which program they would like to create. With or without the OOP


Platform Independency
- Python is platform independant, meaning regardless of your operating system. This language can run, similar to that of class
files when running Java

Python is Free and Open Source too!
